In this project, I'll analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and you'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

My  search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. I  also filter group and order data.
